# Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome in any form: pull requests, issues, or
simply feedback on your experience with the library.

## Code contributions

When contributing code, please use the PSR-2 code style standard, even though
this is currently not enforced. Also, run `composer ci` to run all tests that
the continuous integration also runs, to ensure that the pull request will not
be rejected.

Supplying tests for contributed code is a nice gesture, but not required. On the
other hand, if you need to make changes to any existing tests in order to make
them pass, please provide an explanation, as this suggests backward-
incompatibility.
